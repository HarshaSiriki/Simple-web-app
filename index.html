                    <p>This is a video from one of my trips in India. Its a long drive within the 
                        Uttarakhand and Ladakh states which are in the northern most part of India. 
                        The drive is through some beautiful landscapes and water crossings. 
                        Some of the places were Manali, Sarchu, Leh, Pangong lake,
                        Khardungla pass (which is the highest motorable road in the world). 
                        I stayed at homestays, campsites, hotels depending on the destination during the trip. 
                        The importance of this trip was not about the destination but the ride itself. Because 
                        the ride is through beautiful landscapes, watercrossings, sand dunes, off-roading, mountains,
                        valleys.
